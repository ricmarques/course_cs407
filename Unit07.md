**Unit 7: Object Transport** <span id="7"></span> 
*Classes are often designed with reusability in mind.  Programmers can
exchange classes that were written by other programmers to use their
functionality in their own software.  This unit will introduce you to
the concept of object transport.  You will learn how XML can be used to
describe a specific class, sent across the network, and reused by
another user to regenerate a Java class, compile it, and use its API.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 8 hours to complete.

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Explain the usage of classes for reusability.
-   Explain the purpose and achievement of object transport.
-   Compare and contrast serialization and reflection.
-   Complete XML programming tasks to describe a specific class, send it
    across the network, and reuse it as another user to regenerate a
    Java class, compile it, and use its API.
